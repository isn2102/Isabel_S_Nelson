I grew up in Olympia, WA and now live in New York City where I do public health by day and design sets and costumes for theatre by night. I'm interested in sustainable design, as well as responsibly using data to communicate public health research to a wider audience, with the goal of informing policy and practice. I love to doodle, organize, read, hike, and cook.
