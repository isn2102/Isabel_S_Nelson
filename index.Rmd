I grew up in Olympia, WA and now live in New York City where I work in public health by day and design sets and costumes for theatre by night. I'm interested in sustainable design and responsibly using data to communicate public health research to a wider audience. I'd ultimately like to work disseminating research insights to inform public health policy and practice. I love to doodle, organize, read, hike, and build stuff.
